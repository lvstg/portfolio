This repository brings together the work I did before and during my studies at HE2B-ESI.

## BesoreESI
In this folder there two projects ; 'BichonBrithDay' and 'DicoAbète'. These are project I made before my bachelor or during my first years in this school when I didn't have learn the object-oriented. I made other programme before but I unfortunately didn't save them. 
There are not good, they haven't a 'README' file because I made those for the fun without any project too use them after. 
### BichonBirthDay
It's a quizz app for questonning my best friend about our friendship. For my security and my privatie, I delete the question. 
### DicoAbète 
It's an application I made for my sister's project. She was a nurse student and for one of this course, she have the idea to creat an app with the diabetes vocabulary. So she ask me to creat the app and present she idea with a real demo on a random phone.

## IoT
### ConnectedMobileRobot
This project was to creat a connected mobile robot that moves thanks to the movement of a hand via a camera. You can find the detail in the readme of the 'HandTracking61305' programme, in the report and some picture and video.
### Thymio
I created a programme for the Thymio robot gives to him the possibility to escape of a labirynth. Like the last projet there is a demo in video.

## Java
